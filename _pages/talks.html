Retrieval based chatbotï¼šI participated in the design and implementation of retrieval based approaches for chatbots. I experimented some neural network based methods for response selection in chatbots, and helped collaborators ship it to the product environment. Besides, I participated in the context-aware message detection, target at determining if a message is conditioned on its previous conversational history. Above techniques have been shipped to XiaoIce Core-chat service that serves millions of users.
