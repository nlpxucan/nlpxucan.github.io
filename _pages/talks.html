<b>Generation based chatbot(Microsoft Xiaoice v5)</b>：  I participated in the design and implementation of the core generative model, which is built on top of the Seq2Seq model with some modifications for eliminating safe responses. 
The algorithm has been shipped to Microsoft chatbots in China, Japan and Indonesia. Particularly, In Indonesia all the dialogue traffics(1.5 million users) are fully served by my generative model.
