# Bio
* I am a research scientist of Microsoft STCA (Software Technology Center at Asia) NLP Group. I am proficient in building open-domain chatbot and contribute core deep models for chat engines of Microsoft XiaoIce (微软小冰) v5,v6,v8 and Microsoft Rinna (りんな). More details, please refer to <a href="https://nlpxucan.github.io/publications/">Publications</a> tab and <a href="https://nlpxucan.github.io/talks/">Projects</a> tab.
* My research interests lie in natural language processing, chatbot systems, and information retrieval.
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from [Sichuan University](http://http://scu.edu.cn/) and Master's Degree in Computer Technology from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).
